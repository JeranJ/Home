	<p class = "center" id = "W"> It was a dark and stormy night&#46; Kings Valley was filled with the foreigners and the peasants who walked upon the land for their new king&#46; King Estale Cahill had past the night before and therefore the rightful heir to King Estale would become king&#46; The next in line to be king was his only child Kumar Cahill&#46; Though he was of young age Kumar knew his duties to his people&#46; The Kingdom of Abihail&sbquo; or otherwise known as the Kingdom of Power&sbquo; was the largest force among the other five kingdoms&sbquo; the Kingdom of Dorado&sbquo; Kingdom of Adelbert&sbquo; Kingdom of Darcarys&sbquo; and the Kingdom of Bhadyoga&#46; With the high mountains that protect us&sbquo; no army has ever gotten inside the Kingdom of Abihail&sbquo; except for the gang of mercenaries who were known as the Night Watch&#46; These were the men who adorned black and killed King Estale for a prize that no one knows of&sbquo; except for the person who hired them&#46; The Night Watch was a gang of mercenaries which means this was not their true fight&#46; They were hired for many missions who worked for noble men&sbquo; the rich&sbquo; the poor&sbquo; the ones of evil intensions and the ones with a good heart&#46; The only problem was that there was no man without an enemy&sbquo; whether the kindest hearts or the killers of the night because there will always be a disagreement which means men would die if they would do it themselves or had the money for someone else&#46; There were eight men in that gang&sbquo; yet never more than one was ever detected during a mission&#46; These men were experienced in the art of stealth and sword who would cross all five kingdoms to finish a mission&sbquo; for they were men who honored their word and would always finish&#46; To understand the rest of this story you need to know that these are kingdoms separate from each other&sbquo; yet protected from dangers in foreign lands passed the wall&#46; The wall was built long ago&sbquo; so high that no living being can see the top so that no monster would pass&#46; It was built by millions of slaves lead by a man everyone despised&sbquo; Tonald&#46; J&#46; Drump&#46; What is beyond the wall had never been heard of&sbquo; but folk who had seen the top&sbquo; when the sky was clear&sbquo; had seen man in full black for a matter of seconds until it vanished&#46;
 Now you might be confused why I am telling you random facts&sbquo; but they will all piece themselves together&#46; After Tonald built the wall the slaves decided to strike back and they took Tonald on the other side of the wall to leave him&#46; When the slaves were free they returned home to live their lives in the kingdom they chose to serve&#46; Years had come and gone while the wall stood high to protect the innocent&#46; The five kingdoms were at peace at the time until the Night Watch had formed&#46; The Night Watch had created wars and brought sieges among the kingdoms&#46; The kings had never seen so much destruction among their lands during the biggest war they had ever fought&#46; This was no ordinary battle&sbquo; it came to be known as “The War of Five Kings”&#46; This war had left lands devastated by the raging fires set by foes&#46; There were barely enough citizens to call any king’s land a kingdom&sbquo; yet they still decided to fight&#46; Some kingdoms joined forces but near the end of the war there were only three kingdoms left to rule&sbquo; the Kingdom of Abihail&sbquo; the Kingdom of Adelbert&sbquo; and the Kingdom of Darcarys&#46; The Kingdoms of Adelbert and Darcarys merged their kingdoms into the Kingdom of Dragon Stone against the fortified Kingdom of Abihail&#46; King Kumar fought very hard day and night for the rest of his kingdom but they were no match for the Kingdom of Dragon Stone&#46; To save his kingdom Kumar knew he had no choice as he said these words to his fellow warriors and citizens of his kingdom&sbquo; “The enemy of my enemy is my friend&sbquo; I shall ally with the Night Watch&#46; I know most of all what horrible crimes they have committed not only to my family but on all of you&#46; My decision is final&sbquo; and if you must leave because of my decision I understand but without them we will suffer a greater loss that we already have&#46; I am sorry”&#46; The mercenaries were now brought in to the war that they have started so now they must finish it&#46; With the honor in their words they vowed to King Kumar that they will end the war one way or another&#46;
The Night Watch now had infiltrated the Kingdom of Dragon Stone like they used to do before the war&#46; The eight men killed every one of the royal guards and made their way to the grand hall where Edgar Castaldi and Charlemagne Lannister&sbquo; kings of Dragon Stone&sbquo; were executed by the eight men&#46; At that moment everyone except for the Night Watch thought the war was over&#46; Once the Night Watch had returned King Kumar congratulated them&sbquo; knowing he was the last king he claimed all land as part of the Kingdom of Abihail&#46; Suddenly&sbquo; before King Kumar could address the news to the public there was a steel sword through his body&#46; As the king fell in agony he looked up to see nine men&sbquo; the Night Watch in black and another man wearing white and gold&#46; “Who…&#46;&#46; Who are you?” Kumar said slowly and quietly&#46; The man in white said back “I am the leader of the Night Watch&sbquo; I am their father&#46; I am one who lived outside the wall&sbquo; I helped Tonald build his own Kingdom and overthrew him&#46; I am the king outside the wall&sbquo; I am the King of the Wild and now I am the one true king&#46; I am Voora Cahill&#46; Goodbye&sbquo; brother”&#46; 
The new king built a new civilization with him as the new ruler&#46; The people of the kingdoms came to join him while the Night Watch became the royal guards to protect their father&#46; King Voora ruled with an iron fist for the rest of his reign on the land&#46; This is the story my grandfather told me&sbquo; but he also said “One day you will become king grandson and you have to be ready to rule&sbquo; but I know you are ready or your name is not Chandren Aquan Cahill&#46;
