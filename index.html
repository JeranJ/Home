			<p class = "C" > The story begins with the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros as they try to get ready for the long winter&#46; Eddard Stark&sbquo; guardian/king of the north&sbquo; is being asked to be the Hand of the King who would leave to northern home of Winterfell to serve the king&sbquo; Robert Baratheon&sbquo; who Eddard knew well from their childhood&#46; But&sbquo; Eddard think that the previous Hand of the King did not just pass away&#46; Eddard accepts the job&sbquo; but it is to use it to see if his hunch was right&#46;
In Essos&sbquo; the banished family of House Targaryen are planning to go to Westeros and take back their rightful throne&#46; Viserys Targaryen&sbquo; one of the children of House Targaryen&sbquo; arranges for his sister Daenerys and Khal Drogo&sbquo; the leader of 40&sbquo;000 warriors&sbquo; to get married&#46; In doing so they would gain control of all the warriors in order to invade Westeros&#46; But this is not what Daenerys wants to do&sbquo; all she wants is to be safe&sbquo; not to be married to a man she doesnâ€™t know&#46;
Now with winter coming the wall of the Night Watch is getting prepared&#46; The wall is miles high and across to protect the innocent villagers from what lay beyond the wall&#46; If they do not get ready in time everyone will know that winter is coming&#46;
